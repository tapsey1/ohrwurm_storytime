One day in the great land of Germany, A man went to his favorite sausage vendor but found a schloss on the door.
Puzzled and disappointed, he noticed a note pinned to the Schloss on the door that read, 'Follow the clues through Berlin’s Hauptstrasse to find your beloved Bratwurst!
On the back of the note he read, "The Bratwurst can be found in the largest city of Germany."
The man then drove to the nearest Biergarten in his Porsche and ate Gebaeck.  
As soon as he finished his meal, the man hit the Hauptstrasse with determination. 
Finally in Berlin, he thought hard about where to find the next clue.
The man found out the clue was not in Berlin, so he headed to the nearest Flughafen to fly out of Berlin, and continue his search.
As soon as he landed, he headed to a nearby Baeckerei to get something sweet.
He ordered the Apfelkuchen which turned out to be terrible.
Feeling disappointed, he decided to refresh himself with a Doener, hoping the seasoned meat would make up for the unsatisfying Apfelkuchen.
It was then that he encountered Mehlhase, who would provide the next clue.
Mehlhase led the man to an alley where he found a hund, follow the dog and it will lead you to the sausages you seek, Mehlhase stated.
After a delightful hike through the verdant hills above the Moselle, I treated myself to a traditional German dessert, Apfelkuchen, which is a deliciously spiced apple cake.
Intrigued by medieval architecture, I visited the historic Eltz Castle, marveling at its ancient Schloss, an intricate lock that has safeguarded its treasures for centuries.
As the man followed the hund, they arrived at a lively Ratskeller where a hidden compartment revealed the prized Bratwurst, marking the end of his whimsical quest.
